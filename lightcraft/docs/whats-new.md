# What's new in LightCraft

## October 2026

### Presets and profiles
- Import presets from other editors: XMP presets, classic `.lrtemplate` files, "DNG presets" from mobile apps and `.zip`
  bundles of any of these — whole folders at once, grouped by pack. Masks inside presets come along.
- Luminar looks: `.lmp` files and `.mplumpack` collections import as presets (grouped by collection); the sliders
  with a counterpart here come along, the rest is listed.
- 23 new built-in presets: Portrait, Landscape, Urban, Food, Seasons, Vintage and B&W toners.

### Reliability
- Canon CR2 photos from the EOS 7D, 50D, 60D, 550D, 600D, 1200D, 1300D, 5D Mark II and 1D Mark IV (and other
  models whose sensor starts on a green-blue row) no longer come out magenta (issue #85): the colour-filter
  layout is read from each file instead of assumed.
- Exports are never black because of the GPU (issue #78): a GPU render that runs out of device
  memory, exceeds the GPU's buffer limits, hits a driver error or reset, or comes back
  incomplete is redone on the CPU — the file is the same image either way. Work is sent to the GPU
  in short pieces so slow integrated GPUs aren't reset by their watchdog. `ui.inspect` → `perf`
  (`gpuReason`, `gpuFallback`), Help ▸ System Info and Settings ▸ Performance say why the GPU isn't
  used (e.g. a skipped software adapter such as llvmpipe) and why the last render fell back.

### Library
- Rename Photos never overwrites another photo when only the letter case changes (issue #95): on case-sensitive
  volumes (Linux, case-sensitive APFS) `img_1.JPG` next to `IMG_1.JPG` is a different photo and the renamed one gets
  `img_1-1.JPG`; on case-insensitive volumes the case change still goes through.
- Rename Photos reports files it could not move back after a failure (issue #105), e.g. when a network share drops
  mid-batch: the error lists them (old → new) and the library points at their new names (an undoable partial rename),
  so none shows as missing. Renaming one of a raw + JPEG pair copies their shared `IMG_0001.xmp` instead of taking
  it away from the other (issue #92). Find Missing Photos also finds renamed files by their content, prefers a content match
  over a same-name same-size look-alike, and skips (and reports) photos it can't tell apart instead of guessing.
- Smart albums with a rule editor: match all / any / none, nested groups, 26 fields.
- Quick Collection and target album (B in the grid), keyword sets (⌥1–⌥9), colour-label sets.
- Colour-label filter with several labels at once; expandable folder tree in Local.
- Import: copy to any folder, by day / by month / one folder, rename on import, metadata preset, Copy as DNG.
- Import ▸ Move: photos go into the destination (with the same folders and renaming as Copy, e.g.
  `Photos/2026/20260114/20260114_001.jpg`) together with their XMP sidecars; each original leaves the card only after its
  copy is verified and in the library. Duplicates and files that fail stay where they were.
- Watched-folder auto import; Convert to DNG; Duplicate; Build Standard / 1:1 / Smart Previews.
- Export file names use the Rename Photos tokens ({title}, {seq:2}, {date:%Y-%m-%d}…), plus new {num}, {folder}, {lens}, {iso}, {rating}, {creator}.
- Copyright status, rights usage terms and copyright info URL in Info, metadata presets and exports.
- Auto-Tag from Tracklog: GPS locations for your photos from a GPX track log, matched by capture time.
- A change that can't be saved to disk (full or unplugged drive) is no longer silent: the command reports
  "saved in memory but not written to disk", the top bar shows a warning, and LightCraft keeps retrying until the
  save goes through.
- Smaller, faster catalogs: photos you only looked at in Local (never added, rated or edited) are forgotten once
  their folder has not been browsed for 30 days — your files and sidecars stay, and browsing the folder shows them
  again. Change the period (or turn it off) in Settings → Performance.

### Editing
- Auto Sync: edits apply to every selected photo. Auto B&W mix. Automatic versions.
- Colour-range masks: click the photo to sample. Luminance ranges: range bar, smoothness, luminance map.
- ⌘-drag to straighten, ⇧G Guided Upright, a grid while transforming.

### Viewing and sharing
- Slideshow, second window, All Metadata, System Info.
- Edit in External Editor (⇧⌘E): a 16-bit TIFF copy, stacked, refreshed when you come back.
- Lossy DNG files and Smart Previews open as raw photos.
- Compressed Nikon NEFs (lossless and lossy compressed, 12- and 14-bit — e.g. D3200, D5100, D7000, D750, D850, Z 50)
  now develop from the raw data instead of the camera's embedded JPEG, so a B&W or other picture style set in the
  camera no longer gets baked in. Photos already imported as "preview only" switch over on Reload. (Files that
  Nikon splits into two differently compressed halves still use the preview for now.)
